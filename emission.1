.SH NAME
emission \- do calculations on measurements from the author's valve tester

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B emission
<valve type> ht=... curr=... [nb=...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B emission
processes the test results from the author's valve tester. The command
line arguments are:

.TP
.B designation
The valve type (EL84, ECC83, etc; case-insensitive).
.TP
.B ht=...
HT (anode) voltage as measured from the red socket, in volts. This
will be around 150V for preamp valves and around 300V for power
valves.
.TP
.B curr=...
Cathode current as measured from the green socket (where 1mV measured
equals 1mA of current).
.TP
.B nb=...
Negative bias voltage as measured from the blue socket and set with
the knob to the left of it (optional).

.P
.B emission
will then calculate power dissipation (both at 100% for cathode biased
valves and at 70% for fixed biased valve), and emit warnings if any
measured values exceed maximum values (or in case of negative bias,
are more than 50% off the recommended testing value).

them by their European designations.
